# :wave: Hey there! I'm Bryson.

Linux enthusiast, FOSS admirer, Java programmer, and firm believer that dill pickles are superior.

I am known for various projects, including but not limited to:
* Creating new combat strategies in Minecraft with [Resurrection](https://github.com/brysonsteck/resurrection).
* Bringing [Wiimmfi](https://wiimmfi.de) to mobile with [Wiimmfi Watcher](https://github.com/brysonsteck/wiimmfi-watcher).
* Brewing the most degenerate Discord bots known to man.

You can read more about me or these projects on [my website](https://brysonsteck.net). Just know that we are on iffy terms if you love bread and butter pickles.
